### Portfolio Website.

## Navigation: 

### The logo at the top left will always take you to the homepage. In order to access the resume page click on the computer artwork (notice the text "cv" pops up on the screen). In order to access the bio page hover over the computer until you see the fingerprint appear, that is where you need to click to get to the bio page.

## Design:

### I tried to incorporate a simple, clean, retro-modern design. I also wanted to include some quirky elements, like with navigation and some of the artwork.
